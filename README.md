# polo-wrapper

this thing is an API wrapper in python for poloniex. poloniex is a bitcoin/altcoin cryptocurrency exchange founded by a guy who studied classical music at uni and couldn't make a living out of that so he created a cryptocurrency exchange instead.

the thing i'm trying to get this to do is move your trades along a user-defined line on a price chart, which is a thing in technical analysis. besides that i'm mainly just familiarising myself with the polo api
